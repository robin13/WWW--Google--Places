Revision history for WWW-Google-Places

        - Made base_url a ro attribute so that it can be redefined on initialisation.
          This can be useful if you are tunneling through a firewall to access the API
        - Removed "type" (json or xml) because it is always parsed before returning
          to user as a perl data structure, so better to just do one data format
          than try to support two.
          In addition using xml type caused errors because whatever the result,
          it was parsed as if json.
